# New Features and Bug Fixes in Densify Container Data Collection V4

Version 4 introduces significant updates of Densify Container Data Collection. It resides in a new [Github repository](https://github.com/densify-dev/container-data-collection), which replaces the [versions 1-3 repository](https://github.com/densify-dev/Container-Optimization-Data-Forwarder), to be deprecated on June 30th, 2024.

While the core PromQL queries remain the same, with the exception of some improvements and bug fixes, the container data collection has been re-architected to enable new features and improve performance.

## Multiple Kubernetes Clusters Support

Version 4 allows you to run a single job to collect data for multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single Prometheus server / observability platform. Using Prometheus labels, the job determines which data belongs to which cluster.

## External Observability Platform Support

Due to Prometheus' data retention and long-term storage limitations, many customers are now using observability platforms.

Version 4 collects data from external Prometheus servers (Prometheus running outside the Kubernetes cluster where the data collection runs), as well as external observability platforms that implement the Prometheus API. Specific authentication mechanisms are included to facilitate the access control these platforms require.
