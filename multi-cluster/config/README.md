# Configuration 

Use this [config.yaml](https://github.com/densify-dev/container-config/blob/main/examples/config.yaml) file as a template.

# Configuration Variables

The order of precedence is: command line flags, environment variables, config file (typically provided as a config map).

For how to override values in the YAML file with command line flags and/or enviroment variables, please see [here](../../single-cluster/config/README.md).
